The Flask by Example is a full-stack tutorial that is very useful to beginners. It integrates Redis and machine learning tasks to provide a comprehensive learning exercise.

This is an old-<i>ish</i> article; I've seen comments that are marked as posted six years ago. So I guess it was written in 2013. It was updated in 2015 and 2016 to Python3.

I worked out the whole application, which is explained in seven parts, on my laptop and am sharing my experience here.

My environment is:
* Windows 10
* Cmder
* Python

I installed the requisite software using the very convenient Chocolatey package manager.
